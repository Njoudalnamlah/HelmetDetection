# Helmet Detection with YOLOv5

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify helmets in images. The dataset was sourced from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), and the YOLOv5 model was customized and trained in a Google Colab environment.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python
- YOLOv5
- Roboflow
- PyTorch
- Google Colab
- OpenCV (optional for inference)


## ðŸ“Š Results

- The model was trained for 50 epochs and then 150.
- Evaluation was done using YOLOv5 built-in validation.
